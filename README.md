# Prayusha-Portfolio

The outline of my portfolio which will be updated constantly throughout my time at UTA Bootcamp.

## Description

This is the baseline/outline of my professional portfolio which will be constantly updated. The outline of this was made with HTML to add all the content on the webpage and CSS was used for the styling and lay out.

## User Story

AS A hiring company, I WANT to be able to view the potential emoloyee's professional portfolio so that I can view all of their work. I WANT navigation to their linkedin and github accounts and I WANT to see a navigation bar for each section which describes themselves, the work they have done, and their contact information.

## Usage

This is my professional portfolio webpage, which describes a little bit about myself. There is a navigation bar on the top right of the webpage which can be used to go to the respective section of the page. There are also pictures of the work I have done so far and in the very bottom there are multiple links which should take user to the respective accounts I have. This is also the best way to contact me.
